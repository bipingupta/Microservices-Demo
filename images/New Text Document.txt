OAuth 2.0 Overview

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that specifies different ways a third-party application can obtain limited access to determined set of resources.

OAuth defines four roles:

resource owner: An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.

resource server: The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

client: An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization. The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).

authorizationserver: The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
