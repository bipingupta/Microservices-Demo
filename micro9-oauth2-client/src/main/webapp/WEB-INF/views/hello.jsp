<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>In order to see this, you should have had to authenticate via an OAuth2 Authorization Server</p>

<p>If you were previously authenticated with the Authorization Server, you might not have had to enter a userid or password.</p>

<p>Depending on how long ago you granted permission to use the scope, you might not have been prompted to provide specific authorization.  (We set it to expire after 30 seconds)</p>
